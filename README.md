# Minesweeper v. 2

Minesweeper implemented in Python.

This version of Minesweeper works with no GUI, only in the IDLE/Terminal interface. Thus, it's not very good :neutral_face:.

In order to play the game, clone/download this repo and execute the "game.py" file.

However, if you want a better version of this game, check out [this repo](https://github.com/PauloGSC/minesweeper) :thumbsup:.
